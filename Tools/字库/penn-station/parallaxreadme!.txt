This font was created by Parallax.  It is intendedfor free distribution and use in any medium or format,but is not to be re-sold, or for commercial use.  I designed itto make the world a better place... not to make yourwallet fatter.Spruce up your CD jacket, website, or your term paper,but please remember that this font, and all others designedby Parallax, are (c)1999-2001 David C. Lovelace.Check out the Parallax website at:  http://www.umop.comFeed the starving fontmaker.
